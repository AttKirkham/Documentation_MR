      <p align="center">Mixed reality (MR) is the combined body of knowledge involving that engages with two key immersive technologys: Virtual reality (AR) and augmented reality (AR). The term, popularized by Microsoft, attempts to combine techniques and theory applicable to both domains into one accessible term. While VR and AR maintain significant differences, as aimmersive technologies they are grounded in similar mechanical, electrical, and design theories. Condensing these ideas has allowed for greater transference of operations and perspective - thus allowing for a more fluid exchange of ideas between associated platforms.</p>
    <p>It is therefore useful to conceive of MR, VR, and AR as three distinct realms that coexist at a center-point: MR. MR is not entirely an umbrella term for these other two domains. Ultimately, it is a means of translating concepts (No matter how similar or different) between the two.</p>
    <p>As VR and AR further evolve and define themselves more clearly, the importance of a term such as "mixed reality" may yet arise. However, at this time, it exists as a logical formality. The most important part about mixed reality is not understanding its theories from an abstract point of view.</p>
    <p>Rather, you must dive right into the nitty gritty: What makes AR AR and what makes VR VR?</p>

      <p align="center">As with all bodies of knowledge, there are certain key terms that are very handy to be aware of. Here are a few obvious ones and not so obvious ones:</p>
  <ul id="terms">
    <li>Mixed Reality</li>
    <li>Virtual Reality</li>
    <li>Augmented Reality</li>
    <li>Augmented Virtuality</li>
    <li>Virtuality Continuum</li>

    <li>Head Mounted Display (HMD)</li>
    <li>360 Video</li>
    <li>Oculus Rift</li>
    <li>HTC Vive</li>
    <li>Google Cardboard</li>
    <li>Snapchat</li>
    <li>Tron</li>
   </ul>
      <p>We have already discussed mixed reality at length. <i>Virtual Reality</i> is engagement with a fully simulated atmosphere. The 90's cult classic film, <i>Tron</i> largely popularized the concept and cemented its visualization in pop culture. While we have yet to reach the point of accessing a virtual world as wild as the one below, we have begun to understand the basis for its being - A concept known as <i>the virtuality continuum</i>.</p>
<img src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/tron1.jpg?w=700&h=393&crop=1" id="tron" align="center">            
<p>The continuum exists between reality (That which is actual) and virtuality (That which is simulated) with a constant blur between the two. It focuses on variations and iterations of both, and acts as one of the primary discussion points for the many-worlds interpretation theory. THAT theory posits, firstly, that reality may be simulated. Secondly, if reality is simulated, it asserts many other realities (Perhaps an infinite amount) may exist as simulations as well. Regardless of any truth to the theory, it has led to an engagement between technology and physics that has been the source of much revolution. Where electronics was the primary innovator, chemical and quantum theory are seeing use cases in mixed reality.</p>
      <p>Due to this, it is important to recognize <i>augmented reality</i> as the middle-ground point between entirely virtual and reality entire. Where <i>augmented reality</i> is utilizing technology to simulate objects in the real world there exists, too, a mirror concept. <i> Augmented virtuality</i> is the process of projecting the real world into the simulated. Augmented reality is using a photograph filter for a selfie. Augmented virtuality is using a 3D scanner on a necklace to create a 3D object for programming purposes!</p>
<p>By the end of this documentation, you will have significant familiarity with the mixed reality world in all its depths. This docment seeks to inform you, the reader, with far more information than you need in a digestible manner.</p>
<p>You will be introduced to surface concepts, as well as specifics about topics such as the electronics being used for various platforms. While this document seeks to be as informative as possible, it is not a textbook. References and resources have been provided so that you may continue your path.</p>
      <p>Welcome to the metaverse.</p>

      <p align="center">The most popular form of mixed reality is virtual reality. At least once, everyone has seen some form of exposure to head-mounted displays (HMD's) be it in the real world, from a commercial, or at your local library. A powerful technology, virtual reality uses a variety of visual platforms to generate a user experience that focuses on generating what it would be like to step into another world</p>
      <p>Popularized as a gaming platform, virtual reality found its start in the early ages of computer games. In fact, it predated most MS-DOS based games. Many attribute hardware limitations to its failure to integrate in the 70's and 80's. However, the 2010's have brought about a resurgence with multiple organizations competing to increase user adoption rates.</p>
      <p>Google, Facebook, HTC, Samsung, Microsoft, and others have utilized very different tactics to try and connect their technologies to the public. Where Facebook has focused on consumer entertainment, Google has honed in on the education sector. Many teachers have used their cheapest platform, Cardboard, as an alternative to field trip. Ultimately, the different specifications of each company's hardware dictates the limitations that a software developer will face.</p>
      <p>The big difference between VR and AR lies with its hardware. VR tends to rely on more experimental technologies than AR, such as 3D scanners, body trackers, and haptic peripherals. AR relies on various different sensors, but tends to be more about resolving software challenges.</p>
      <p>VR and AR ultimately generate very, very different types of software. Virtual reality is very much focused on generating entire worlds. Augmented reality is focused upon blending them.</p>

      <p>Virtual reality, in a nutshell, is truly the generation of worlds. It is the means of touring a temple in Tibet, a portal into a high fantasy environment, or the means of inspecting a house under construction. The major distinction in what types of virtual reality experiences exist is simple: Entertainment and enterprise. These product types are also the primary distinctions for augmented reality.</p>
      <p>Enterprise software is focused on practical applications, such as mind-mapping or simulations for training purposes. Entertainment software is anything from a tool for virtual painting to a video game. While a bulk of the software available for VR is entertainment based, enterprise innovations are slowly beginning to take the stage.</p>
      <p>This is an important shift, as if VR is to become as widely used as its investors hope then it is going to be key for the technology to be experienced as more than a toy.</p>

        <h1 align="center">Augmented Reality</h1>             </header>
      <p align="center">Far more abstract than its purely virtual counterpart, augmented reality is a far more expansive domain in the immersive technology world.</p>
      <p>Live image filtering was one of the first cases of augmented reality hitting the masses. Having the ability to take a photograph and edit it in realtime paved the way for greater innovations. That same camera, that same hardware, is now capable of recognizing facial structure and broadcasting far more complex filters in real-time. Through Snapchat or Instagram, a user can use algorithms to apply virtual makeup or transform themselves into whatever filters the company has made available.<p>
      <p>As a result, augmented reality tends to see far more use cases in enterprise than in entertainment. However, it was ironically an entertainment application that made augmented reality a household term as well as reigniting attention for mixed reality as a whole.</p>
      <p>It all started with Pikachu.</p>
      
      <img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/143/590x/Pokemon-Go-news-1065226.jpg?r=1546197701460" id="pokemon" align="center">
      
      <p>Niantic Labs created an experience that was simple yet elegant in the popular Pokemon Go. All it required was a stylish front-end, geomapping, a catalogue of animations, and script that every game needs to run. And yet, the result tapped energies more powerful than Niantic could manage: Nostalgia, control, and FOMO (Fear of missing out).</p>
      <p>People were living out their childhood fantasies en masse. Others, with little to no experience with Pokemon or the technology, joined them. It is the most successful mixed reality use case to date, and the work it required was minimal. Yet, this was a specialized use case. As stated, augmented reality is used by many people nearly every day.</p>
      <p>Yet, augmented reality tends to sit on the back burner when considered next to virtual reality. Many developers are more interested in the greater hardware capacity that is available with virtual reality. Investors, too, are focused on the larger dollar amounts associated with that side of the industry in particular. Many groups that have been steeped in the industry are far more focused on generating a return - having, in many cases, been rooted in virtual reality for some time.</p>
      <p>As time goes forward, it is very likely that others will attempt to enter the augmented reality space due to its accessibility, flexibility, and profitability. VR is a high-risk and high-reward atmosphere, where AR is generally a safer ground with lower stakes.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="HARDWARE">
    <header>
        <h1 align="center">Hardware</h1>             </header>
      <p align="center">To understand the core of mixed reality, you need to understand the hardware types being employed. There are quite a few of them. Augmented reality, in its current inception, primarily exists through cellular phones, tablet computers, and through engaging with internet-of-technology (IOT) systems and sensors. So too, it possesses numerous self-contained innovations. Microsoft's Hololens is a specialized device that tends shift between either virtual or augmented reality, for instance. So too, Google's Glass product was one of the first AR-specific innovations.</p>
      <p>Virtual reality, however, works exclusively with head-mounted displays and various peripherals. For both AR and VR, we will examine peripherals later. Within this section, we are primarily focusing on the headsets and controllers utilized with VR. Trackers, haptic innovations, and otherwise are covered in the peripherals section.</p>
      <p>The primary hardware needs for AR hardware relate upon stereoscopic depth. As a result, most platforms require at least two cameras by which to capture this depth. A sensor that works in tandem with GPS tracking is also a must. Having this hardware allows for software to be designed with the necessary variables to recognize environment, location, movement, and other key variables.</p>
      
      <img src="https://roadtovrlive-5ea0.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/oculus-wireless-rift-patent-2.png" id="schem" align="center">
      
      <p>VR's HMD's are a subject of many different design iterations and associated discussions. However, the core needs remain the same. A headset needs 1-2 displays, ideally one for each user's eye. These displays need to be sensitive to the user, so as to prevent potential blindness or image blurring. Resolution of the screen is critical as it will directly inform a programmer's limitation (As will the processor, graphics card, and any cooling system).</p>
      <p>A headset also requires a power source. It either needs to be wired or wireless. This is a major design issue for most mobility-focused VR platforms as the power necessary to run a machine tends to influence the cost of a unit significantly. However, numerous means of offsetting this have been explored.</p>
      <p>One such method is by using an external computer. This prevents the need for installing memory hardware into the headset proper, aside from that which needs to be executed. Having files available remotely, and processed locally, may result in compatibility or speed issues, however. Ultimately, the design approach for headset systems still exists without a primary method. Similar conventions are utilized, but every major platform takes these conventions in very different directions per their associated peripherals.</p>

      <p align="center">The software utilized in MR is vast in its types. However, we are examining the conventional approaches to its creation for both VR and AR purposes.</p>
      <p>The most popular tool for creating MR experiences is Unity. Unity is a free development program that allows the user to create unique 2D and 3D programs. It hosts a library of assets that one can use for their projects. However, platforms such as Google's Poly or Blocksmith host assets as well.</p>
      <p>Unity, however, is a creation engine. It is not the Minecraft of programming. The user still needs to write scripts to generate different events within the system. Indeed, visual programming languages have not yet automated the MR program making process entire.</p>
      <p>The languages utilized most are C# and C++, when it comes to generating 3D events. Python, Java, and Ruby tend to be king for graphical user interfaces (GUI) or other 2D needs. Here are five instances of their very different syntax:
        
      <p>C# in action!</p>
      
      <code>       
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Hello 
    {
        static void Main() 
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

            // Keep the console window open in debug mode.
            Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}        
          </code>
        
      <p>Compared to Python...</p>
         <code>
#!/usr/bin/python3
# Say hello, world.
print ("Hello, world!")
      </code>
 
      <p>What about C++?</p>
       <code>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
        
      </code>
 
         <p>Can't forget about Java!</p>
      <code>
        
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
        
      </code>
        
         <p>And you always have Ruby...</p>
      <code>
        
$ irb
>> puts "Hello, world!"
Hello, world!
=> nil
        
      </code>

<p>Ultimately, the language that you program in will matter significantly. Augmented reality applications, for instance, do not always rely on any of the above languages. They rely on server-side languages (Such as SQL, PHP) and can utilize web languages as well - Your classic HTML, CSS, Javascript combinations. The biggest issue with software in the MR industry comes down to your design and, more critically, its feasibility.</p>
         <p>Everyone wants to design the next great MR program - The next Beat Sabre, the next Pokemon Go, and become the industry's next Microsoft. However, often a good idea becomes conflated by trying to reach widely. An audience is built, it is not found.</p>
         <p>For software designers in the industry, the biggest issue tends to be timeliness. It would be perfect if a product could be available on every platform at once - However, this is rarely realistic for hobbyists or even small companies.</p>
         <p>The way to software success is a tight design informed by realistic key performance indicators (KPI's) ahead of time. You cannot be in a million places at once. But you can be in one place, and invite a million people one at a time.</p>
         <p>And, if you are loud enough, they just might stay.</p>

      <p align="center">While augmented reality does indeed make use of some peripherals, it is primarily VR that explores this side of the hardware world.</p>
      <p>Haptics have been the focus point. Haptics use force feedback to understand how the user is moving. It allows software to gauge the user's location and actions. The result has led to full-body suits that are capable of temperature change as well as gloves which recognizing what each individual figure is doing at any given moment.</p>
      <p>Sensory input and output are the major focus points of MR peripherals. Several HMD's utilize eye tracking software to adjust their display in realtime. Such innovations, when optimized, help prevent motion sickness in a user. Tracking is performed as well, by using cameras and motor sensors to tell where the user is moving and how fastly they are moving.</p>
      <p>Several experimental peripherals have entered the market as well. Ranging from apparati that infuse an experience with physical smells to basic handles that can generate virtual weaponry - the sky has been the limit. In some instances, literally.</p>

      <p align="center">Mixed reality has been applied in numerous different instances already. It only looks to be growing, as well.</p>
      <p>In education, MR has been used to simulate different periods of history in the classroom. As stated prior, it has also been utilized to replace field trips as well. As a training tool, it has seen usage with the military and even companies such as KFC.</p>
      <p>In real estate, it has allowed users to tour a home remotely. Facebook has even attempted to modernize video calling to orchestrate realistic avatars. Their innovations have been... not so realistic, but the platform has been leveraged to create some sense of intimacy.</p>
      <p>Speaking of intimacy, the adult entertainment industry has made notorious usage of MR to create immersive experiences. Yet, so too have psychologists been employing the technology to treat various disorders such as PTSD.</p>
      <p>The ways in which MR is being used grows every single day. It relies upon the developers to continue innovating and for evangelizers or salesfolk to continue driving interest, however.</p>
